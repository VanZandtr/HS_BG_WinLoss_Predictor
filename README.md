# HS_BG_WinLoss_Predictor
Predict Hearthstone Battlegrounds Outcomes

##Current Project Status
main.py current asks to build your current board as well as the opponent's board and then predicts outcome potentials through a numbered amount of simulations (currently set at 10)

##To-do:
* Add card keyword effects (Deathrattle, Battlecry, etc.)
* Automate eventually
